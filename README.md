## What's ppfetch?
The ppfetch was created to be a simple, basic, and posix fetch, you don't need a config file to customize ppfetch, or a handbook to use it. It's in your principle, it still has a long way to go to make it the friendly fetch I want it to become. It's a libre software, write your changes, make it your, or make a pull request and become a contributor to the project.
